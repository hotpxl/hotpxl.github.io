I implemented it in Python 3.3 and strictly according to [RFC 959](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc959). Though it does not offer a GUI, it supports the most essential, but not all, features of the RFC. It even supports different network layers, including IPv4 and IPv6. Also the server has support for multitasking, allowing it to respond to different clients at the same time.\r\n* Tools and Languages:\r\n  * [Python](http://www.python.org/)\r\n\r\n## Ray Tracer\r\n* Time: June, 2013\r\n* Repository: TBU\r\n* Description:\r\n\r\n## Mesh Simplifier\r\n\r\n## Battleship","google":"UA-57231898-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
