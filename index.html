  <h1>般若波羅蜜多心經</h1>
  <p>
  观自在菩萨，行深般若波罗蜜多时，照见五蕴皆空，度一切苦厄。舍利子，色不异空，空不异色，色即是空，空即是色，受想行识，亦复如是。舍利子，是诸法空相，不生不灭，不垢不净，不增不减。是故空中无色，无受想行识，无眼耳鼻舌身意，无色声香味触法，无眼界，乃至无意识界，无无明，亦无无明尽，乃至无老死，亦无老死尽。无苦集灭道，无智亦无得，以无所得故。菩提萨埵，依般若波罗蜜多故，心无挂碍，无挂碍故，无有恐怖，远离颠倒梦想，究竟涅槃。三世诸佛，依般若波罗蜜多故，得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。故知般若波罗蜜多是大神咒，是大明咒，是无上咒，是无等等咒，能除一切苦，真实不虚。故说般若波罗蜜多咒，即说咒曰：揭谛揭谛，波罗揭谛，波罗僧揭谛，菩提娑婆诃。

  <h1>The Heart Sutra</h1>
  <p><small>(Translated by E. Conze, 1967)</small></p>
  <p>
  Homage to the Perfection of Wisdom the Lovely, the Holy!<br>
  Avalokita (觀自在), the Holy Lord and Bodhisattva (菩薩),<br>
  was moving in the deep course of the Wisdom which has gone beyond<br>
  (行深般若波羅密多時).<br>
  He looked down from on high, He beheld but five heaps (五蘊),<br>
  and He saw that in their own-being they were empty.<br>
  Here, O Sariputra (舍利子),<br>
  form is emptiness and the very emptiness is form ;<br>
  emptiness does not differ from form, form does not differ from emptiness,<br>
  whatever is emptiness, that is form,<br>
  the same is true of feelings, perceptions, impulses, and consciousness (受、想、行、識).<br>
  Here, O Sariputra (舍利子),<br>
  all dharmas are marked with emptiness (諸法空相);<br>
  they are not produced or stopped, not defiled or immaculate, not deficient or complete.<br>
  Therefore, O Sariputra,<br>
  in emptiness there is no form nor feeling, nor perception, nor impulse, nor consciousness ;<br>
  No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind (無眼耳鼻舌身意);<br>
  No forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touchables or objects of mind (無色聲香味觸法);<br>
  No sight-organ element, and so forth, until we come to :<br>
  No mind-consciousness element (無意識界);<br>
  There is no ignorance,<br>
  no extinction of ignorance, and so forth (無無明，亦無無明盡), until we come to :<br>
  There is no decay and death, no extinction of decay and death (乃至無老死，亦無老死盡).<br>
  There is no suffering, no origination, no stopping, no path (無苦集滅道).<br>
  There is no cognition, no attainment and no non-attainment (無智亦無得).<br>
  Therefore, O Sariputra,<br>
  it is because of his non-attainmentness (以無所得故)<br>
  that a Bodhisattva (菩薩), through having relied on the Perfection of Wisdom,<br>
  dwells without thought-coverings (心無罣礙).<br>
  In the absence of thought-coverings he has not been made to tremble,<br>
  he has overcome what can upset, and in the end he attains to Nirvana (涅槃).<br>
  All those who appear as Buddhas in the three periods of time fully awake to the utmost,<br>
  right and perfect Enlightenment because they have relied on the Perfection of Wisdom<br>
  (三世諸佛，依般若波羅密多故，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。).<br>
  Therefore one should know the prajnaparamita (般若波羅密多)<br>
  as the great spell (大神咒), the spell of great knowledge (大明咒), the utmost spell (無上咒),<br>
  the unequalled spell (無等等咒), allayer of all suffering (能除一切苦),<br>
  in truth -- for what could go wrong (真實不虛)?<br>
  By the prajnaparamita has this spell been delivered.<br>
  It runs like this:<br>
  gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha.<br>
  (揭諦，揭諦，波羅揭諦，波羅僧揭諦菩提，薩婆訶。)<br>
  (Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone altogether beyond,<br>
  O what an awakening, all-hail !)<br>
  This completes the Heart of perfect Wisdom.<br>
