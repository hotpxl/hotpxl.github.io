# Is God Lonely?

We know that God wants a loving relationship with us. But He cannot impose His power on us. What He wants is a loving relationship.

Like the story Soren Kierkegaard told in *The King and the Maiden*, the king cannot just go and express his love.

God cannot come down and express His love. He is condemned to be the perfect God, is He? The lonelist of all.
